# Calculator
https://jaym9000.github.io/Calculator/

Built a calculator from scratch. The calculator has the ability to add, subtract, divide and multiply.
The calculator can also string multiple operators together for example: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.

The biggest hurdle to overcome in this project was storing the first and second number and doing an operation on them.

I overcame this hurdle by adding a temp variable which will allow me to know if the first value has been stored yet or if I am yet to store the first value.
